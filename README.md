# DbaToolsVisualInterface
This is an attempt to make a GUI for the popular "DBATools" powershell module.

This script opens a window, allowing a user to select a list of DBATools cmdlets.
Users can enter parameters and view results in a grid format.

As currently written, none of the cmdlets presented will alter your SQL Server. This is a tool for getting information quickly.

Enhancements to be added:
*Entering credentials
*saving results to CSV
*Cache parameters
